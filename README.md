   gemini
   ```

3. **The system will automatically greet you and start the workflow:**
   - "Hello! What do you want to blog about today?"

4. **Follow the conversational workflow:**
   - Answer questions about your topic, audience, and style
   - Say "Proceed to reference" when ready to move forward
   - Say "Proceed to style" to generate configuration
   - Say "Proceed to blog" to create your blog post
   - Say "Review blog" for quality checks

## 🔄 How It Works

The Gemini Blog Machine uses the `GEMINI.md` file as an instruction set for the Gemini CLI. When you run `gemini` in this directory, it automatically loads these instructions and guides you through a structured workflow.

**Workflow stages:**
```
Discussion → SEO Check → Reference → Style → Generate → Review → Publish
```

**Files created during the process:**
- `style.json` - Your blog configuration
- `[slug].md` - Your generated blog post
- `review.json` - Quality review criteria
- `research.md` - Research findings (optional)

## 📝 Workflow

- Topic and main idea
- Target audience

- Code examples (for tutorials)

### 2. SEO Research

### 3. Reference Gathering

  "audience": "beginners",

    "hookType": "question",
    "sections": [...]
